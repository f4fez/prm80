* [PRM8070](doc/PRM8070.md): **Supported**

PRM80 frequencies
=================
The PRM80 family work for many frequencies and have different radio board for each [PRM80 band code](doc/PRM80_bands.md). Look at the [PRM80 band code list](doc/PRM80_bands.md) to know supported version and specific modifications for the ham radio firmware.

Modifications
=============
Frequency independant modification:

* [EPROM update](doc/EPROM_update.md)
* [Connectors informations](doc/Connectors_informations.md)
* [Mike gain](doc/Mike_gain.md)
* [Tx power ajustement](doc/Tx_power_ajustement.md)
* [Serial interface](doc/Computer_control.md)
* [1750 Hz tone](doc/1750Hz_tone.md)
You can also look at the [PRM80 band code list](doc/PRM80_bands.md) to know specific radio board mods.

Firmware Frequencies
--------------------
The firmware is released for 2 ham band depending of the original PRM80 band:

* 2m [prm80x0_144.bin](doc/Prm80x0_144.bin.md)
* 70cm [prm80x0_430.bin](doc/Prm80x0_430.bin.md)
